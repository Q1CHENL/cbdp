# Glossary

## Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)

Specific, measurable targets for service performance, such as availability, latency, or error rates.

## Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)

Formal contracts between a service provider and a customer, specifying some SLOs, penalties for violation.

## Reliable Crossover

A network topology feature ensuring uninterrupted data transmission by providing redundancy and failover mechanisms. Examples: Redundant Network Paths, Load Balancing & Failover etc.

## CAP Theorem

It is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

## Fan-out

A single request is distributed to multiple servers or services to parallelize work.

## Failure mode analysis (FMA)

Identify the types of failures your application may experience and possible recovery strategies.

## Crash-Stop

When a node fails, it never comes back.

## Crash-Recovery

A node fails but may restart and rejoin the system later.

## Unreliable Network

A network where messages can be delayed, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order.

## Unreliable clocks

Clocks on different nodes in a distributed system may not be perfectly synchronized.

## Star-Schema

A database design where a central fact table (containing transactional data) is surrounded by dimension tables (containing descriptive attributes).

## Straggler

A slow-running task in a distributed computing system that delays overall job completion.

## OLAP

An approach to quickly answer multi-dimensional analytical (MDA) queries
